        Hello there! I'm a 20-year-old developer from the Philippines, currently studying
        Information Technology at DMC College Foundation. I’m passionate about making software
        that’s simple, helpful, and easy to use. I enjoy working across different platforms and
        technologies, always aiming to create tools that solve real problems and make everyday tasks
        easier. Whether it's designing clean user interfaces or troubleshooting code, I focus on
        clarity, usefulness, and making things work smoothly.

        I love learning through hands-on experience especially when it involves coding challenges,
        community projects, or exploring new frameworks like Angular, MAUI, and ASP.NET Core. I
        believe that good software isn’t just about writing code it’s about understanding people’s
        needs and building solutions that truly help. That’s why I care deeply about user centered
        design and clean architecture, making sure everything I build is easy to understand and
        maintain.

        Beyond the technical side, I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others grow. I thrive in
        friendly, collaborative environments where ideas flow freely and learning never stops.
        Whether I’m working solo or with a team, I bring a practical mindset, a positive attitude,
        and a drive to turn ideas into meaningful results.
