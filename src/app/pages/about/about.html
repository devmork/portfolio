      I'm a 20-year-old developer from the Philippines, currently studying Information Technology at
      DMC College Foundation. I’m passionate about creating software that’s simple, helpful, and
      easy to use. I enjoy working across different platforms and technologies, always aiming to
      build tools that solve real problems and make everyday tasks easier. Whether I’m designing
      clean user interfaces or fixing bugs, I focus on clarity, usefulness, and making things work
      smoothly.

    <p class="tracking-normal leading-8">
      I learn best through hands-on experience—especially coding challenges, community projects, and
      exploring new frameworks like Angular, MAUI, and ASP.NET Core. I believe great software starts
      with understanding people’s needs, so I care deeply about user-centered design and clean
      architecture. I also love sharing what I learn and helping others grow. Whether I’m working
      solo or with a team, I bring a practical mindset, a positive attitude, and a drive to turn
      ideas into real, helpful results.
